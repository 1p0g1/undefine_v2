# Database Cleanup Progress - July 2, 2025

## ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETED: Remove user_stats Redundancy**

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅  
**Date**: July 2, 2025

### **Changes Made**:

1. **Updated `/api/streak-status.ts`**: ✅ DONE
   - Changed from `user_stats.current_streak` to `player_streaks.current_streak`
   - Uses verified schema from screenshot evidence

2. **Updated `/api/theme-stats.ts`**: ✅ DONE  
   - Changed from `user_stats` lookup to `players` table validation
   - Simplified player existence check

3. **Updated `/api/guess.ts`**: ✅ DONE
   - Replaced complex `updateUserStats()` with minimal `ensureUserStatsForFK()`
   - Both completion paths now use FK-only approach
   - Stats calculation removed (comes from `player_streaks` and `game_sessions`)

### **Impact**:
- **Performance**: Reduced database writes (no more complex user_stats calculations)
- **Reliability**: Uses actual data sources instead of abandoned table
- **Maintenance**: Eliminated redundant data sync issues

## ✅ **PHASE 2 COMPLETED: Fix Streak Calculation**

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅  
**Date**: July 2, 2025

### **Root Cause Fixed**:
- Old trigger only counted consecutive daily wins
- Beth's wins had gaps (June 11, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26)
- Old trigger reset streak on any gap

### **Solution Applied**:
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20250702000001_fix_player_streaks_trigger.sql` **DEPLOYED**
- ✅ New trigger allows 7-day gaps between wins
- ✅ Recalculation function fixed all historical data
- ✅ Beth's streak corrected: **8-win streak** (was 1)

### **Verification**:
- **BEFORE**: current_streak: 1, highest_streak: 2
- **AFTER**: current_streak: 8, highest_streak: 8 ✅
- **Date Range**: June 11-26, 2025 ✅

## 📋 **PHASE 3: Missing Tables (PENDING)**

**Priority**: **LOW** (theme feature already working)

### **Missing Components**:
1. `current_week_theme_data` table (theme system works without it)
2. Various other migrations per screenshot verification

### **Status**: **NOT URGENT** - Core features working
