# All-Time Leaderboard Implementation

## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS**

This document explains the data flow from individual games to all-time statistics.

## 📊 **DATA FLOW EXPLAINED**

### **1. Game Completion → `game_sessions`**
When a player completes a word game:
- ⏱️ **Time taken**: Total seconds to complete
- 🎯 **Guesses used**: Number of attempts needed
- ✅ **Success**: Whether they solved it or not
- 📅 **Timestamp**: When the game was completed

### **2. Daily Ranking → `leaderboard_summary`**
At the end of each day, completed games are processed into daily rankings:

**Column Meanings:**
- **`player_id`**: Unique player identifier
- **`rank`**: Final ranking for that day (1 = first place, 2 = second, etc.)
- **`was_top_10`**: Boolean - did they finish in the top 10?
- **`best_time`**: Time in seconds to complete that day's word
- **`guesses_used`**: Number of guesses they needed
- **`date`**: Date of the game
- **`word_id`**: Unique identifier for that day's word

**Why "best_time"?** 
In your current system, players typically play once per day, so "best_time" is simply their completion time for that word. If multiple attempts were allowed, it would be their fastest time.

### **3. All-Time Aggregation**
The `/api/leaderboard/all-time` endpoint processes all historical `leaderboard_summary` records to calculate:

## 🏆 **STATISTICS CALCULATED**

### **Core Stats (per player)**
- **Total Games**: Count of records in `leaderboard_summary`
- **Total Wins**: Count where `rank = 1` (first place finishes)
- **Win Percentage**: `(total_wins / total_games) * 100`
- **Average Time**: Mean of all `best_time` values
- **Average Guesses**: Mean of all `guesses_used` values
- **Best Time Ever**: Minimum `best_time` across all games
- **Top 10 Finishes**: Count where `was_top_10 = true`
- **Last Played**: Most recent `date` value

### **Leaderboard Categories**

#### **🥇 Highest Win Rate**
- **Metric**: Win percentage
- **Filter**: Minimum 3 games (for meaningful statistics)
- **Ranking**: Highest percentage first
- **Shows**: Games played, total wins, win percentage

#### **⚡ Fastest Players**
- **Metric**: Average completion time
- **Filter**: Minimum 3 games
- **Ranking**: Lowest average time first
- **Shows**: Games played, average time, personal best time

#### **🎯 Most Consistent**
- **Metric**: Average guesses needed
- **Filter**: Minimum 5 games (more data for consistency)
- **Ranking**: Lowest average guesses first
- **Shows**: Games played, average guesses, top 10 finishes

#### **📈 Most Active**
- **Metric**: Total games played
- **Filter**: None
- **Ranking**: Most games first
- **Shows**: Total games, total wins, last played date

## 💾 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **API Endpoint**
```
GET /api/leaderboard/all-time
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "topByWinRate": [...],
    "topBySpeed": [...],
    "topByConsistency": [...],
    "topByGames": [...],
    "totalPlayers": 42,
    "totalGames": 156
  }
}
```

### **Data Aggregation Logic**
```sql
-- Example calculation from leaderboard_summary
SELECT 
  player_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_games,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE rank = 1) as total_wins,
  AVG(best_time) as average_time,
  AVG(guesses_used) as average_guesses,
  MIN(best_time) as best_time_ever,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE was_top_10) as top_10_finishes,
  MAX(date) as last_played
FROM leaderboard_summary
GROUP BY player_id;
```

## 🎮 **USER EXPERIENCE**

### **Access Points**
1. **Settings Menu** → "📊 All-Time Stats" button
2. **Modal Interface** with tabbed categories
3. **Mobile-responsive** design

### **Features**
- **Multiple Leaderboard Views**: Switch between win rate, speed, consistency, and activity
- **Minimum Game Filters**: Ensures meaningful statistics
- **Rich Data Display**: Shows relevant metrics for each category
- **Summary Statistics**: Total players and games across the system

## 🔄 **DATA FRESHNESS**

**Real-time Updates**: All-time statistics are calculated on-demand from the latest `leaderboard_summary` data, so they're always current.

**Historical Foundation**: Using existing `leaderboard_summary` data means we have immediate historical statistics without waiting for new snapshots.

## 🚀 **READY TO USE**

This implementation works immediately with your existing data:
- ✅ **API endpoint** created and functional
- ✅ **Frontend component** with full UI
- ✅ **Menu integration** through settings modal
- ✅ **Multiple leaderboard categories** implemented
- ✅ **Responsive design** for all devices

**No database changes needed** - works with current `leaderboard_summary` table structure!
