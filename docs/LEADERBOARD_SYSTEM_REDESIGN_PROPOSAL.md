# Leaderboard System Redesign Proposal
*Created: July 2, 2025*
*Updated: July 2, 2025 - Added Critical Bug Analysis & Game Data Flow Documentation*

## üö® CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED

### **Issue**: Incorrect Leaderboard Modal Display
**Problem**: The GameSummaryModal shows "Today you didn't rank - Better luck tomorrow!" when a player hasn't even played yet (e.g., on page refresh).

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Location**: `client/src/App.tsx` lines 78-85
2. **Trigger Logic**: 
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (gameState.isComplete) {
       if (timerRef.current) clearInterval(timerRef.current);
       summaryTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
         setShowSummary(true);  // ‚ùå SHOWS MODAL
         setCanReopenSummary(false);
       }, 5000);
       return;
     }
   }, [gameState.isComplete, gameStarted]);
   ```

3. **Problem**: `gameState.isComplete` is `true` from localStorage even when no actual game has been played in current session
4. **Impact**: Modal appears immediately on page load/refresh showing incorrect "didn't rank" message

### **Fix Required**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
if (gameState.isComplete) {
  // Shows modal even if no game played this session
}

// AFTER (Fixed)
if (gameState.isComplete && gameStarted) {
  // Only show modal if game was actually played this session
}
```

**Implementation Priority**: **IMMEDIATE** - This confuses users and makes the app appear broken

## üéØ Executive Summary

The current leaderboard system has several critical issues that need addressing:
1. **üö® CRITICAL BUG**: Leaderboard modal shows incorrectly when no game played
2. **Streak tracking is broken** - Players' streaks are resetting incorrectly  
3. **Redundant metrics** - Win Rate and Consistency tabs show similar data to Activity/Top 10
4. **Inconsistent data** - Different tabs show conflicting information
5. **Poor user experience** - Confusing navigation between similar metrics

## üìä Game Data Tracking Flow Documentation

### **Complete Data Flow: Game Logic ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Leaderboards**

#### **1. Game Initiation Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User clicks Ready] --> B[startNewGame()]
    B --> C[API: /api/word]
    C --> D[GameService.startNewGame()]
    D --> E[Create GameSessionState]
    E --> F[localStorage save]
    F --> G[Game UI Updates]
```

**Key Components**:
- **Frontend**: `client/src/services/GameService.ts`
- **API**: `pages/api/word.ts`
- **Storage**: localStorage + Supabase `game_sessions` table
- **State**: `GameSessionState` interface

#### **2. Guess Submission Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User submits guess] --> B[submitGuess()]
    B --> C[API: /api/guess]
    C --> D[Database Operations]
    D --> E[Update game_sessions]
    E --> F[Update player_streaks]
    F --> G[Calculate scores]
    G --> H[Return GuessResponse]
    H --> I[Update UI state]
```

**Database Tables Involved**:
- `game_sessions` - Individual game records
- `player_streaks` - Current/best streaks  
- `players` - Player information
- `words` - Word definitions and clues

#### **3. Game Completion Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Game ends] --> B[isComplete = true]
    B --> C[Trigger leaderboard fetch]
    C --> D[API: /api/leaderboard]
    D --> E[Aggregate daily results]
    E --> F[Calculate rankings]
    F --> G[Show GameSummaryModal]
    G --> H[Display results + nickname prompt]
```

#### **4. Leaderboard Data Compilation**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Daily Games] --> B[game_sessions table]
    B --> C[Aggregate by player]
    C --> D[Calculate metrics]
    D --> E[Rank players]
    E --> F[Multiple leaderboard views]
    
    F --> G[Win Rate Tab]
    F --> H[Consistency Tab]
    F --> I[Streaks Tab]
    F --> J[Activity Tab]
    F --> K[Top 10 Tab]
```

### **Key Database Schema**

#### **game_sessions Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
  word_id UUID REFERENCES words(id),
  is_won BOOLEAN,
  guesses_used INTEGER,
  time_taken INTEGER, -- seconds
  score INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  -- Theme-related fields
  theme_guess TEXT,
  theme_guess_correct BOOLEAN
);
```

#### **player_streaks Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_streaks (
  player_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES players(id),
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  best_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_win_date DATE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### **Leaderboard Calculation Logic**
```sql
-- Daily leaderboard query example
SELECT 
  p.nickname,
  gs.time_taken,
  gs.guesses_used,
  gs.score,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY gs.score DESC, gs.time_taken ASC) as rank
FROM game_sessions gs
JOIN players p ON gs.player_id = p.id
WHERE DATE(gs.created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
  AND gs.is_won = true
ORDER BY rank;
```

### **Current Issues in Data Flow**

1. **Streak Calculation Bug**: 
   - Logic in `player_streaks` update triggers may be flawed
   - Beth's streak showing as 1 despite extensive play history

2. **Game State Persistence Issue**:
   - `gameState.isComplete` persists in localStorage
   - Causes modal to show on page refresh without actual gameplay

3. **Inconsistent Ranking Logic**:
   - Different tabs use different sorting/ranking algorithms
   - Win rate calculations may not match between views

## üîç Current Issues Analysis

### 1. Streak Tracking Problems
**Issue**: Beth should have a much longer streak but shows as "Current: 1"
- **Root Cause**: Streak calculation logic may be flawed in database triggers
- **Impact**: Demotivates consistent players
- **Evidence**: Screenshots show Beth with extensive activity but streak=1

### 2. Redundant Leaderboard Tabs
**Current Tabs:**
- üèÜ **Win Rate** - Shows win percentage (redundant)
- üéØ **Consistency** - Shows consistency metrics (unclear purpose)
- üî• **Streaks** - Shows current/best streaks (useful)
- üìä **Activity** - Shows games played + win rate (duplicates Win Rate)
- üèÖ **Top 10** - Shows top 10 players (useful)

**Problems:**
- Win Rate tab duplicates Activity tab's win rate column
- Consistency tab purpose is unclear vs other metrics
- Too many tabs create confusion

### 3. Data Inconsistencies
**Observed Issues:**
- Different tabs show different player rankings
- Win rates may not match between tabs
- Activity counts don't align with streak data

## üé® Proposed Solution: Simplified 3-Tab System

### **Tab 1: üèÜ Champions** (Replaces Win Rate + Top 10)
**Purpose**: Show the best performing players
**Metrics**: 
- Overall ranking by score/performance
- Win rate percentage
- Total games played
- Best streak achieved

**Sorting**: By overall performance score (combination of win rate, consistency, and activity)

### **Tab 2: üî• Streaks** (Keep existing)
**Purpose**: Show current and best streaks
**Metrics**:
- Current streak
- Best streak ever
- Last played date
- Streak status (active/broken)

**Sorting**: By current streak (descending)

### **Tab 3: üìä Activity** (Enhanced version)
**Purpose**: Show who's most active and engaged
**Metrics**:
- Total games played
- Games this week
- Last played date
- Win rate (secondary metric)

**Sorting**: By total games played (descending)

## üîß Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Critical Bug Fixes (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Fix GameSummaryModal trigger logic**
   ```typescript
   // In App.tsx, line 78
   if (gameState.isComplete && gameStarted) {
     // Only show modal if game was actually played this session
   }
   ```

2. **Add game session validation**
   - Ensure modal only shows after actual gameplay
   - Clear stale localStorage data appropriately

### Phase 1: Fix Streak Tracking
1. **Audit streak calculation logic**
   - Review `player_streaks` table
   - Check streak update triggers
   - Verify date calculations

2. **Implement proper streak tracking**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Fix streak calculation
   UPDATE player_streaks 
   SET current_streak = (
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM consecutive_wins 
     WHERE player_id = player_streaks.player_id
   );
   ```

3. **Add streak debugging endpoints**
   - `/api/debug/streak/{playerId}` 
   - Show streak history and calculations

### Phase 2: Redesign Leaderboard Components
1. **Create new leaderboard structure**
   ```typescript
   interface LeaderboardTab {
     id: 'champions' | 'streaks' | 'activity';
     name: string;
     icon: string;
     columns: LeaderboardColumn[];
   }
   ```

2. **Implement unified data fetching**
   - Single API endpoint: `/api/leaderboard/unified`
   - Returns all data needed for all tabs
   - Reduces API calls and ensures consistency

3. **Update UI components**
   - Simplify tab navigation
   - Consistent styling across tabs
   - Clear metric explanations

### Phase 3: Data Consistency Fixes
1. **Create unified player stats view**
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW unified_player_stats AS
   SELECT 
     p.id,
     p.nickname,
     COUNT(gs.id) as total_games,
     COUNT(CASE WHEN gs.is_won THEN 1 END) as games_won,
     ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN gs.is_won THEN 1 END)::float / COUNT(gs.id) * 100, 1) as win_rate,
     ps.current_streak,
     ps.best_streak,
     MAX(gs.created_at) as last_played
   FROM players p
   LEFT JOIN game_sessions gs ON p.id = gs.player_id
   LEFT JOIN player_streaks ps ON p.id = ps.player_id
   GROUP BY p.id, p.nickname, ps.current_streak, ps.best_streak;
   ```

2. **Add data validation checks**
   - Automated tests for streak calculations
   - Consistency checks between tables
   - Alert system for data anomalies
