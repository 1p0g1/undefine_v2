# Leaderboard System Redesign Proposal
*Created: July 2, 2025*
*Updated: July 2, 2025 - Added Critical Bug Analysis & Game Data Flow Documentation*

## üö® CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED

### **Issue**: Incorrect Leaderboard Modal Display
**Problem**: The GameSummaryModal shows "Today you didn't rank - Better luck tomorrow!" when a player hasn't even played yet (e.g., on page refresh).

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Location**: `client/src/App.tsx` lines 78-85
2. **Trigger Logic**: 
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (gameState.isComplete) {
       if (timerRef.current) clearInterval(timerRef.current);
       summaryTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
         setShowSummary(true);  // ‚ùå SHOWS MODAL
         setCanReopenSummary(false);
       }, 5000);
       return;
     }
   }, [gameState.isComplete, gameStarted]);
   ```

3. **Problem**: `gameState.isComplete` is `true` from localStorage even when no actual game has been played in current session
4. **Impact**: Modal appears immediately on page load/refresh showing incorrect "didn't rank" message

### **Fix Required**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
if (gameState.isComplete) {
  // Shows modal even if no game played this session
}

// AFTER (Fixed)
if (gameState.isComplete && gameStarted) {
  // Only show modal if game was actually played this session
}
```

**Implementation Priority**: **IMMEDIATE** - This confuses users and makes the app appear broken

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

The current leaderboard system has several critical issues that need addressing:
1. **üö® CRITICAL BUG**: Leaderboard modal shows incorrectly when no game played
2. **Streak tracking is broken** - Players' streaks are resetting incorrectly  
3. **Redundant metrics** - Win Rate and Consistency tabs show similar data to Activity/Top 10
4. **Inconsistent data** - Different tabs show conflicting information
5. **Poor user experience** - Confusing navigation between similar metrics

## üìä Game Data Tracking Flow Documentation

### **Complete Data Flow: Game Logic ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Leaderboards**

#### **1. Game Initiation Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User clicks Ready] --> B[startNewGame()]
    B --> C[API: /api/word]
    C --> D[GameService.startNewGame()]
    D --> E[Create GameSessionState]
    E --> F[localStorage save]
    F --> G[Game UI Updates]
```

**Key Components**:
- **Frontend**: `client/src/services/GameService.ts`
- **API**: `pages/api/word.ts`
- **Storage**: localStorage + Supabase `game_sessions` table
- **State**: `GameSessionState` interface

#### **2. Guess Submission Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User submits guess] --> B[submitGuess()]
    B --> C[API: /api/guess]
    C --> D[Database Operations]
    D --> E[Update game_sessions]
    E --> F[Update player_streaks]
    F --> G[Calculate scores]
    G --> H[Return GuessResponse]
    H --> I[Update UI state]
```

**Database Tables Involved**:
- `game_sessions` - Individual game records
- `player_streaks` - Current/best streaks  
- `players` - Player information
- `words` - Word definitions and clues

#### **3. Game Completion Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Game ends] --> B[isComplete = true]
    B --> C[Trigger leaderboard fetch]
    C --> D[API: /api/leaderboard]
    D --> E[Aggregate daily results]
    E --> F[Calculate rankings]
    F --> G[Show GameSummaryModal]
    G --> H[Display results + nickname prompt]
```

#### **4. Leaderboard Data Compilation**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Daily Games] --> B[game_sessions table]
    B --> C[Aggregate by player]
    C --> D[Calculate metrics]
    D --> E[Rank players]
    E --> F[Multiple leaderboard views]
    
    F --> G[Win Rate Tab]
    F --> H[Consistency Tab]
    F --> I[Streaks Tab]
    F --> J[Activity Tab]
    F --> K[Top 10 Tab]
```

### **Key Database Schema**

#### **game_sessions Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
  word_id UUID REFERENCES words(id),
  is_won BOOLEAN,
  guesses_used INTEGER,
  time_taken INTEGER, -- seconds
  score INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  -- Theme-related fields
  theme_guess TEXT,
  theme_guess_correct BOOLEAN
);
```

#### **player_streaks Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_streaks (
  player_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES players(id),
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  best_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_win_date DATE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### **Leaderboard Calculation Logic**
```sql
-- Daily leaderboard query example
SELECT 
  p.nickname,
  gs.time_taken,
  gs.guesses_used,
  gs.score,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY gs.score DESC, gs.time_taken ASC) as rank
FROM game_sessions gs
JOIN players p ON gs.player_id = p.id
WHERE DATE(gs.created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
  AND gs.is_won = true
ORDER BY rank;
```

### **Current Issues in Data Flow**

1. **Streak Calculation Bug**: 
   - Logic in `player_streaks` update triggers may be flawed
   - Beth's streak showing as 1 despite extensive play history

2. **Game State Persistence Issue**:
   - `gameState.isComplete` persists in localStorage
   - Causes modal to show on page refresh without actual gameplay

3. **Inconsistent Ranking Logic**:
   - Different tabs use different sorting/ranking algorithms
   - Win rate calculations may not match between views

## üîç Current Issues Analysis

### 1. Streak Tracking Problems
**Issue**: Beth should have a much longer streak but shows as "Current: 1"
- **Root Cause**: Streak calculation logic may be flawed in database triggers
- **Impact**: Demotivates consistent players
- **Evidence**: Screenshots show Beth with extensive activity but streak=1

### 2. Redundant Leaderboard Tabs
**Current Tabs:**
- üèÜ **Win Rate** - Shows win percentage (redundant)
- üéØ **Consistency** - Shows consistency metrics (unclear purpose)
- üî• **Streaks** - Shows current/best streaks (useful)
- üìä **Activity** - Shows games played + win rate (duplicates Win Rate)
- üèÖ **Top 10** - Shows top 10 players (useful)

**Problems:**
- Win Rate tab duplicates Activity tab's win rate column
- Consistency tab purpose is unclear vs other metrics
- Too many tabs create confusion

### 3. Data Inconsistencies
**Observed Issues:**
- Different tabs show different player rankings
- Win rates may not match between tabs
- Activity counts don't align with streak data

## üé® Proposed Solution: Simplified 3-Tab System

### **Tab 1: üèÜ Champions** (Replaces Win Rate + Top 10)
**Purpose**: Show the best performing players
**Metrics**: 
- Overall ranking by score/performance
- Win rate percentage
- Total games played
- Best streak achieved

**Sorting**: By overall performance score (combination of win rate, consistency, and activity)

### **Tab 2: üî• Streaks** (Keep existing)
**Purpose**: Show current and best streaks
**Metrics**:
- Current streak
- Best streak ever
- Last played date
- Streak status (active/broken)

**Sorting**: By current streak (descending)

### **Tab 3: üìä Activity** (Enhanced version)
**Purpose**: Show who's most active and engaged
**Metrics**:
- Total games played
- Games this week
- Last played date
- Win rate (secondary metric)

**Sorting**: By total games played (descending)

## üîß Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Critical Bug Fixes (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Fix GameSummaryModal trigger logic**
   ```typescript
   // In App.tsx, line 78
   if (gameState.isComplete && gameStarted) {
     // Only show modal if game was actually played this session
   }
   ```

2. **Add game session validation**
   - Ensure modal only shows after actual gameplay
   - Clear stale localStorage data appropriately

### Phase 1: Fix Streak Tracking
1. **Audit streak calculation logic**
   - Review `player_streaks` table
   - Check streak update triggers
   - Verify date calculations

2. **Implement proper streak tracking**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Fix streak calculation
   UPDATE player_streaks 
   SET current_streak = (
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM consecutive_wins 
     WHERE player_id = player_streaks.player_id
   );
   ```

3. **Add streak debugging endpoints**
   - `/api/debug/streak/{playerId}` 
   - Show streak history and calculations

### Phase 2: Redesign Leaderboard Components
1. **Create new leaderboard structure**
   ```typescript
   interface LeaderboardTab {
     id: 'champions' | 'streaks' | 'activity';
     name: string;
     icon: string;
     columns: LeaderboardColumn[];
   }
   ```

2. **Implement unified data fetching**
   - Single API endpoint: `/api/leaderboard/unified`
   - Returns all data needed for all tabs
   - Reduces API calls and ensures consistency

3. **Update UI components**
   - Simplify tab navigation
   - Consistent styling across tabs
   - Clear metric explanations

### Phase 3: Data Consistency Fixes
1. **Create unified player stats view**
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW unified_player_stats AS
   SELECT 
     p.id,
     p.nickname,
     COUNT(gs.id) as total_games,
     COUNT(CASE WHEN gs.is_won THEN 1 END) as games_won,
     ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN gs.is_won THEN 1 END)::float / COUNT(gs.id) * 100, 1) as win_rate,
     ps.current_streak,
     ps.best_streak,
     MAX(gs.created_at) as last_played
   FROM players p
   LEFT JOIN game_sessions gs ON p.id = gs.player_id
   LEFT JOIN player_streaks ps ON p.id = ps.player_id
   GROUP BY p.id, p.nickname, ps.current_streak, ps.best_streak;
   ```

2. **Add data validation checks**
   - Automated tests for streak calculations
   - Consistency checks between tables
   - Alert system for data anomalies

## üîç **Streak Tracking Investigation & Table Audit**

### **Beth's Streak Investigation (ID: 277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e)**

#### **Step 1: Check Current Streak Data**
```sql
-- Check Beth's current streak record
SELECT 
  player_id,
  current_streak,
  best_streak,
  last_win_date,
  updated_at
FROM player_streaks 
WHERE player_id = '277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e';
```

#### **Step 2: Analyze Beth's Game History**
```sql
-- Get Beth's recent game sessions to verify wins
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as game_date,
  is_won,
  guesses_used,
  time_taken,
  score,
  created_at
FROM game_sessions 
WHERE player_id = '277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### **Step 3: Calculate Expected Streak Manually**
```sql
-- Calculate consecutive wins from most recent backwards
WITH recent_games AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as game_date,
    is_won,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY created_at DESC) as game_order
  FROM game_sessions 
  WHERE player_id = '277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e'
    AND DATE(created_at) >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
),
consecutive_wins AS (
  SELECT 
    game_date,
    is_won,
    game_order,
    -- Stop counting when we hit the first loss
    CASE 
      WHEN is_won THEN 1 
      ELSE 0 
    END as win_flag
  FROM recent_games
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as calculated_current_streak
FROM consecutive_wins 
WHERE win_flag = 1 
  AND game_order <= (
    SELECT COALESCE(MIN(game_order), 999) 
    FROM consecutive_wins 
    WHERE win_flag = 0
  );
```

#### **Step 4: Check Streak Update Triggers**
```sql
-- Find all functions/triggers related to streak updates
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  triggername,
  tgtype,
  proname as function_name
FROM pg_trigger t
JOIN pg_class c ON t.tgrelid = c.oid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
JOIN pg_proc p ON t.tgfoid = p.oid
WHERE c.relname IN ('game_sessions', 'player_streaks')
ORDER BY tablename, triggername;
```

#### **Step 5: Audit Streak Calculation Logic**
```sql
-- Check if there are any obvious data inconsistencies
SELECT 
  p.nickname,
  ps.current_streak,
  ps.best_streak,
  ps.last_win_date,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN gs.is_won THEN 1 END) as total_wins,
  MAX(CASE WHEN gs.is_won THEN DATE(gs.created_at) END) as actual_last_win_date,
  COUNT(gs.id) as total_games
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN player_streaks ps ON p.id = ps.player_id
LEFT JOIN game_sessions gs ON p.id = gs.player_id
WHERE p.id = '277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e'
GROUP BY p.id, p.nickname, ps.current_streak, ps.best_streak, ps.last_win_date;
```

### **Database Table Usage Audit**

Based on the Supabase schema shown, let's audit which tables are actually used:

#### **‚úÖ ACTIVELY USED TABLES**

1. **`players`** - ‚úÖ **ESSENTIAL**
   - Stores player IDs, nicknames
   - Used by: All game logic, leaderboards, authentication
   - **Verdict**: Keep

2. **`words`** - ‚úÖ **ESSENTIAL** 
   - Stores daily words, clues, definitions
   - Used by: Word API, game initialization
   - **Verdict**: Keep

3. **`game_sessions`** - ‚úÖ **ESSENTIAL**
   - Stores individual game records
   - Used by: Game logic, leaderboards, scoring
   - **Verdict**: Keep

4. **`player_streaks`** - ‚úÖ **ESSENTIAL**
   - Stores current/best streaks
   - Used by: Leaderboard streak tab, game completion
   - **Verdict**: Keep (but needs fixing)

5. **`theme_attempts`** - ‚úÖ **ESSENTIAL**
   - Stores theme guesses
   - Used by: Theme of the Week feature
   - **Verdict**: Keep

#### **ü§î POTENTIALLY REDUNDANT TABLES**

6. **`leaderboard_summary`** - ‚ùì **QUESTIONABLE**
   - Purpose: Pre-computed leaderboard data?
   - **Investigation needed**: Do we actually use this or compute leaderboards on-demand?
   - **Query to check**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if leaderboard_summary is being populated
   SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(updated_at), MIN(updated_at) 
   FROM leaderboard_summary;
   ```

7. **`daily_leaderboard_snapshots`** - ‚ùì **QUESTIONABLE**
   - Purpose: Historical daily leaderboard records?
   - **Investigation needed**: Are we using this for historical analysis?
   - **Query to check**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if snapshots are being created
   SELECT snapshot_date, COUNT(*) as entries
   FROM daily_leaderboard_snapshots 
   GROUP BY snapshot_date 
   ORDER BY snapshot_date DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

8. **`user_stats`** - ‚ùì **QUESTIONABLE**
   - Purpose: Aggregated user statistics?
   - **Investigation needed**: Is this redundant with game_sessions aggregation?
   - **Query to check**:
   ```sql
   -- Compare user_stats with game_sessions aggregation
   SELECT 
     'user_stats' as source,
     COUNT(*) as player_count,
     AVG(games_played) as avg_games
   FROM user_stats
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 
     'game_sessions' as source,
     COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as player_count,
     AVG(game_count) as avg_games
   FROM (
     SELECT player_id, COUNT(*) as game_count 
     FROM game_sessions 
     GROUP BY player_id
   ) gs;
   ```

9. **`scores`** - ‚ùì **QUESTIONABLE**
   - Purpose: Separate scoring table?
   - **Investigation needed**: Is this redundant with game_sessions.score?
   - **Query to check**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if scores table is populated and used
   SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(created_at) FROM scores;
   ```

#### **üîß UTILITY TABLES**

10. **`schema_migrations`** - ‚úÖ **KEEP**
    - Database migration tracking
    - **Verdict**: Essential for deployment

11. **`trigger_log`** - üîç **AUDIT**
    - Debug logging for triggers
    - **Query to check usage**:
    ```sql
    -- Check if trigger_log is actively used
    SELECT 
      trigger_name,
      COUNT(*) as log_count,
      MAX(created_at) as last_logged
    FROM trigger_log 
    GROUP BY trigger_name 
    ORDER BY last_logged DESC;
    ```

12. **`v_trigger_performance`** - üîç **AUDIT**
    - Performance monitoring view
    - **Query to check**:
    ```sql
    -- Check if this view is actually used
    SELECT * FROM v_trigger_performance LIMIT 5;
    ```

### **Recommended Investigation Steps**

#### **Step 1: Run Beth's Streak Analysis**
```bash
# Create a script to run these queries
cat > investigate_beth_streak.sql << 'EOF'
-- Beth's Streak Investigation
-- ID: 277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e

\echo 'Current streak record:'
SELECT 
  current_streak,
  best_streak,
  last_win_date,
  updated_at
FROM player_streaks 
WHERE player_id = '277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e';

\echo 'Recent game history:'
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as game_date,
  is_won,
  guesses_used,
  time_taken,
  created_at
FROM game_sessions 
WHERE player_id = '277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 15;

\echo 'Consecutive wins calculation:'
WITH recent_games AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as game_date,
    is_won,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY created_at DESC) as game_order
  FROM game_sessions 
  WHERE player_id = '277b7094-7c6c-4644-bddf-5dd33e2fec9e'
    AND DATE(created_at) >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
)
SELECT 
  game_date,
  is_won,
  game_order,
  SUM(CASE WHEN is_won THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (ORDER BY game_order) as running_wins
FROM recent_games
ORDER BY game_order;
EOF
```

#### **Step 2: Create Table Usage Analysis Script**
```bash
# Create a comprehensive table audit
cat > audit_table_usage.sql << 'EOF'
-- Table Usage Audit

\echo 'Table sizes and activity:'
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  n_tup_ins as inserts,
  n_tup_upd as updates,
  n_tup_del as deletes,
  n_live_tup as live_rows,
  last_vacuum,
  last_analyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY n_live_tup DESC;

\echo 'Recent activity by table:'
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  GREATEST(last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze) as last_activity
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
ORDER BY last_activity DESC NULLS LAST;
EOF
```

#### **Step 3: Potential Table Cleanup Recommendations**

Based on investigation results, we may be able to:

1. **Merge redundant tables**:
   - If `user_stats` duplicates `game_sessions` aggregation ‚Üí Remove `user_stats`
   - If `scores` duplicates `game_sessions.score` ‚Üí Remove `scores`

2. **Archive historical tables**:
   - `daily_leaderboard_snapshots` ‚Üí Keep if used for analytics, archive if not
   - `trigger_log` ‚Üí Truncate old entries, keep recent for debugging

3. **Optimize frequently used tables**:
   - Add indexes on `game_sessions` for common queries
   - Optimize `player_streaks` trigger performance

### **Expected Findings**

**If Beth's streak is actually correct (1)**:
- She may have had a recent loss breaking her streak
- The bug fix prevented the modal issue but streak calculation was working

**If Beth's streak is incorrect**:
- Trigger logic has bugs in consecutive win calculation
- `last_win_date` doesn't match actual last win
- Need to rebuild streak data from game_sessions

**Table Usage Results**:
- Likely 3-4 tables can be removed or merged
- Some tables may be legacy from old implementations
- Focus resources on the core 5-6 essential tables
