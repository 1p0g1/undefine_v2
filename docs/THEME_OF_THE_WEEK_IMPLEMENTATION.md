# Theme of the Week Feature - Implementation Documentation

## Overview
The Theme of the Week feature allows players to guess the weekly theme that connects a set of 7 words throughout the week. Players can make one guess per day and earn statistics tracking their theme guessing performance.

## Feature Specifications

### Core Functionality
- **Weekly Themes**: 7 words per week (Monday-Sunday) share a common theme
- **Daily Guessing**: One theme guess attempt per player per day
- **Progress Tracking**: Players can see how many themed words they've completed
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive tracking of theme guessing performance
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Accepts variations (e.g., "emotions" = "feelings", "moods")

### User Interface
- **Access**: Click the 'Un¬∑' diamond to open theme guessing modal
- **Modal Interface**: Shows progress, current status, guess input, and statistics
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of correct/incorrect guesses
- **Daily Constraints**: Prevents multiple attempts per day

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

#### New Table: `theme_attempts`
```sql
CREATE TABLE theme_attempts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  player_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_stats(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  theme TEXT NOT NULL,
  guess TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  attempt_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
  words_completed_when_guessed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_word_guesses INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Ensures one guess per player per theme per day
  UNIQUE(player_id, theme, attempt_date)
);
```

#### Updated `words` Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE words ADD COLUMN theme TEXT;
```

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### Core Theme Logic (`src/game/theme.ts`)
- **`getThemeForDate()`**: Determines theme for specific date using weekly calculation
- **`isThemeGuessCorrect()`**: Validates guesses with fuzzy matching
- **`submitThemeAttempt()`**: Handles daily constraint and statistics tracking
- **`getThemeProgress()`**: Returns player progress and status
- **`getPlayerThemeStats()`**: Comprehensive statistics calculation

#### API Endpoints

##### `POST /api/theme-guess`
- Submits theme guesses with validation
- Enforces daily constraint
- Tracks statistics at guess time
- Returns success/failure with feedback

##### `GET /api/theme-status`
- Returns current theme and player progress
- Includes daily status (already guessed, can guess, etc.)
- Shows completion progress across themed words

##### `GET /api/theme-stats`
- Returns comprehensive player statistics
- Total attempts, success rate, average performance
- Historical theme guess data

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Components

##### `ThemeGuessModal.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main interface for theme guessing
- **Features**: 
  - Progress visualization
  - Status indicators (already guessed, need to complete words, etc.)
  - Guess input with real-time validation
  - Statistics display grid
  - Toast notifications for feedback

##### Updated `App.tsx`
- **Integration**: Added theme modal state management
- **Trigger**: UnPrefix component onClick handler
- **Modal Management**: Show/hide functionality

##### Updated `UnPrefix.tsx`
- **Enhancement**: Added optional onClick prop
- **Functionality**: Maintains existing time-based celestial design
- **Accessibility**: Cursor pointer when clickable

#### API Client Updates (`client/src/api/client.ts`)
- **`submitThemeGuess()`**: Submit theme attempts
- **`getThemeStatus()`**: Fetch current status and progress
- **`getThemeStats()`**: Retrieve player statistics

### 4. Business Logic

#### Daily Constraint Enforcement
```typescript
// Database constraint ensures one attempt per day
UNIQUE(player_id, theme, attempt_date)

// API validation
if (existingAttempt) {
  return { alreadyGuessedToday: true };
}
```

#### Statistics Tracking
- **Words Completed When Guessing**: Number of themed words player had solved
- **Total Word Guesses**: Cumulative guesses across all game sessions
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of correct theme guesses
- **Average Performance**: Words typically completed before guessing

#### Fuzzy Matching Logic
```typescript
const synonymMap = {
  'emotions': ['feelings', 'moods', 'sentiments'],
  'space': ['astronomy', 'cosmos', 'universe', 'celestial'],
  // ... additional mappings
};
```

### 5. Data Flow

#### Theme Guess Submission
1. User clicks 'Un¬∑' diamond ‚Üí Opens modal
2. Modal loads current theme status and player statistics
3. User enters guess ‚Üí Validates locally
4. Submit ‚Üí API checks daily constraint
5. API validates guess with fuzzy matching
6. Statistics recorded at submission time
7. Response returned with success/failure
8. Modal updates with new status

#### Progress Tracking
1. Game completion triggers theme word check
2. Theme progress calculated across all themed words
3. Player eligibility determined (‚â•1 word completed)
4. Modal displays current progress visually

## Sample Data

### Current Theme (December 9-15, 2024)
**Theme**: "emotions"
**Words**: HAPPY, ANGRY, EXCITED, NERVOUS, CALM, JEALOUS, PROUD

### Example Statistics Response
```json
{
  "totalThemeAttempts": 5,
  "correctThemeGuesses": 3,
  "averageAttemptsPerTheme": 1.25,
  "averageWordsCompletedWhenGuessing": 2.4,
  "themesGuessed": ["emotions", "colors", "animals"]
}
```

## User Experience

### Access Flow
1. Player completes at least one themed word
2. Clicks 'Un¬∑' diamond (enhanced with click cursor)
3. Modal opens showing:
   - Weekly progress (X/7 words completed)
   - Current guess status
   - Input field (if eligible)
   - Personal statistics

### Feedback States
- **üîí Locked**: Must complete themed word first
- **üìù Available**: Can make guess (input shown)
- **‚úÖ Correct**: Green success state with theme revealed
- **‚ùå Incorrect**: Red error state, try again tomorrow
- **‚è∞ Already Guessed**: Information about existing guess

### Statistics Display
- **Themes Guessed**: Total successful theme identifications
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of correct attempts
- **Avg Words Done**: Average words completed when guessing
- **Total Attempts**: Overall theme guess count

## Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel API Calls**: Theme status and statistics loaded simultaneously
- **Efficient Queries**: Indexed database queries for fast lookups
- **Caching**: API responses use appropriate cache headers

### Error Handling
- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Validation Errors**: Clear messaging for invalid inputs
- **Constraint Violations**: Friendly messaging for daily limits

### Security
- **Player Validation**: All requests validate player existence
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints respect standard limits

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Hint System**: Optional hints for difficult themes
2. **Theme Leaderboards**: Weekly rankings for theme guessing
3. **Streak Tracking**: Consecutive correct theme guesses
4. **Theme History**: Browse past weekly themes
5. **Social Features**: Share theme guess results

### Technical Improvements

2. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile theme modal experience
3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader improvements
4. **Analytics**: Enhanced tracking for theme difficulty tuning

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
```bash
# Run the theme_attempts table migration
supabase db reset --linked
```

### Feature Flags
- Feature is enabled by default
- No configuration changes required
- Backward compatible with existing data

### Monitoring
- Track theme guess success rates
- Monitor API response times
- Watch for daily constraint violations

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Daily Constraint**: Verify one guess per day enforcement
2. **Progress Tracking**: Complete themed words, check progress
3. **Statistics**: Submit multiple guesses, verify calculations
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with no active theme, no completed words

### Automated Testing
1. **API Endpoints**: Unit tests for all theme endpoints
2. **Database Constraints**: Verify unique constraint enforcement
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Test synonym recognition
4. **Statistics Calculation**: Verify mathematical accuracy
