# Streak System Architecture Fix - January 2025

## 🔥 Executive Summary

**Problem:** Flame animations weren't appearing after game wins due to faulty database trigger logic.  
**Root Cause:** Streak trigger was on wrong table using non-existent field.  
**Solution:** Moved trigger to correct table with proper field access.  
**Impact:** Zero code changes required, improved reliability and performance.

---

## 🐛 Problem Analysis

### Original Issue
- Players completing games successfully weren't getting streak updates
- Flame animations weren't appearing after wins
- Inconsistent behavior: some players got streaks, others didn't

### Root Cause Discovery
```sql
-- ❌ BROKEN: Old trigger on leaderboard_summary
IF NEW.is_won = true THEN  -- is_won doesn't exist in leaderboard_summary!
```

**Key Issues:**
1. **Wrong Table:** Trigger fired on `leaderboard_summary` 
2. **Missing Field:** `is_won` only exists in `game_sessions`
3. **Ranking Logic:** Streaks depended on daily leaderboard position, not game completion
4. **Inconsistency:** Players with rank > 1 lost streaks even after winning

---

## ✅ Solution Architecture

### New Trigger Design
```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: New trigger on game_sessions
CREATE TRIGGER update_streaks_on_game_completion
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON game_sessions
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (NEW.is_complete = true)
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_player_streaks_on_game_completion();
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Correct Table:** Fires on `game_sessions` where `is_won` exists
2. **Game-Based Logic:** Streaks based on actual wins/losses, not rankings
3. **Better Performance:** Fires only on game completion, not every leaderboard update
4. **Reliability:** Independent of leaderboard calculation changes

---

## 📊 Data Flow

### Before (Broken)
```
game_sessions (is_won: true) 
    ↓
leaderboard_summary (rank calculation)
    ↓
trigger checks is_won ❌ (doesn't exist)
    ↓
streak = 0 (broken)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
game_sessions (is_won: true)
    ↓
trigger fires immediately ✅
    ↓
player_streaks updated
    ↓
API returns correct streak
    ↓
🔥 Flames appear
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Migration File
- **Location:** `supabase/migrations/20250125000007_move_streak_trigger_to_game_sessions.sql`
- **Safety:** Removes old broken trigger first
- **Backwards Compatible:** No API or frontend changes required

### Key Functions
```sql
-- New function specifically for game completion events
update_player_streaks_on_game_completion()

-- Trigger condition: only fires for completed games
WHEN (NEW.is_complete = true)
```

### Streak Logic
- **Consecutive Days:** Exactly 1 day apart continues streak
- **Same Day:** Multiple games don't double-count
- **Gaps:** Any missed day breaks streak (strict mode)
- **Losses:** `is_won = false` resets streak to 0

---

## 📈 Impact Assessment

### Code Changes Required
**None.** Existing APIs and frontend continue to work unchanged.

### Performance Impact
- **Better:** Triggers fire less frequently (only on game completion)
- **Simpler:** No complex joins or calculations needed
- **Faster:** Direct field access instead of cross-table dependencies

### Reliability Improvements
- **Consistent:** All winning players get streak updates
- **Independent:** No dependency on leaderboard ranking calculations
- **Maintainable:** Logic is in the logical place (game completion)

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Before Fix
```sql
-- Multiple players with wins but streak = 0
player_id: 0a581400..., is_won: true, current_streak: 0 ❌
player_id: b8055bc0..., is_won: true, current_streak: 0 ❌
player_id: 88577b41..., is_won: true, current_streak: 0 ❌
```

### After Fix (Expected)
```sql
-- All winning players should have streak ≥ 1
player_id: 0a581400..., is_won: true, current_streak: 1+ ✅
player_id: b8055bc0..., is_won: true, current_streak: 1+ ✅
player_id: 88577b41..., is_won: true, current_streak: 1+ ✅
```

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Maintainability
- **Single Source of Truth:** Streak logic now lives where game completion happens
- **Easier Debugging:** Can trace streak updates directly to game events
- **Future-Proof:** Independent of leaderboard system changes

### Potential Extensions
- **Streak Types:** Could add different streak variants (weekly, etc.)
- **Performance:** Could add streak snapshots for analytics
- **Features:** Could trigger achievements or notifications

---

## 📝 Migration Instructions

1. **Run Migration:** Execute `20250125000007_move_streak_trigger_to_game_sessions.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test:** Complete a game and verify flame animation appears
3. **Monitor:** Check that streaks update correctly in `player_streaks` table
4. **Rollback:** If issues occur, the old trigger can be restored temporarily

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Flame Animations:** Should appear immediately after all game wins
- **Streak Consistency:** All players completing games should get appropriate streak updates
- **Performance:** No additional API calls or delays
- **Reliability:** Zero false negatives (missed streak updates)
