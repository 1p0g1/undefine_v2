## 🚨 Critical Database Fixes (December 2024)

### ✅ Players Table & Leaderboard Population Fix (December 1, 2024) **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: `leaderboard_summary` table was empty despite completed games due to foreign key constraint failures
- **Root Cause**: Missing entries in `players` table - `leaderboard_summary` requires `player_id` to exist in `players.id`
- **Solution**: Created and executed migration `20241201000000_populate_missing_players_simple.sql`
- **Results**: 
  1. ✅ Populated `players` table from existing `user_stats` and `game_sessions` data
  2. ✅ Populated `leaderboard_summary` from existing winning `scores` entries  
  3. ✅ Auto-calculated rankings using `ROW_NUMBER()` window function
  4. ✅ Set `was_top_10` flag based on calculated rank
  5. ✅ Updated documentation in `docs/database_schema.md`
  6. ✅ Migration applied successfully to production

### ✅ Leaderboard System Verification (December 1, 2024) **COMPLETED**
- **User Issue**: Leaderboard showing "No entries yet" after completing DEFINE word
- **Investigation Results**: 
  - Today's word is "clear" (word_id: `fef9bd6d-00de-4124-8784-cac5c36ac4c6`)
  - User completed "DEFINE" (different word_id)
  - Leaderboard correctly shows no entries for today's word "clear"
- **Conclusion**: **System working correctly!** 
  - Leaderboard only shows completions for today's specific word
  - API endpoints working properly with fallback mechanisms
  - Database population successful
  - Player ID system functioning correctly
- **User Experience**: To see leaderboard entries, complete today's word ("clear") instead of previous words

### ✅ Test Data Seeding & API Column Alignment (December 1, 2024) **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: SQL errors when seeding test data due to column name mismatches between ERD and API code
- **Root Cause**: API code used outdated column names (`completion_time_seconds`, `score`) vs actual ERD structure (`best_time`, no score in leaderboard_summary)
- **Solution**: 
  1. ✅ **Created test data** with 5 fun player names (Testy McTestson, Word Smith, Doctor Verbose, Seed McData, Paul Al-Hempo)
  2. ✅ **Fixed foreign key dependencies** by ensuring `user_stats` entries exist before `leaderboard_summary` 
  3. ✅ **Updated API column mapping** in `/api/leaderboard` to use correct ERD structure
  4. ✅ **Added date filtering** to show only today's leaderboard entries
  5. ✅ **Enhanced player names** by joining with `players.display_name`
- **Technical Fixes**:
  - `best_time` instead of `completion_time_seconds` in leaderboard_summary
  - Removed non-existent `score` column references  
  - Added proper `date` filtering for daily leaderboards
  - Maintained backward compatibility by mapping `best_time` → `completion_time_seconds` in API response
- **Result**: Leaderboard API now correctly reads from actual database schema with test data visible

## 🎯 Next Priority Tasks

### 🔄 **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Test Leaderboard Functionality**: Verify leaderboard API endpoints return data
2. **Complete Game Testing**: Test full game flow from start to leaderboard display

  - 4 strategically positioned crater details
  - Varied crater sizes (2px-5px) with inset shadows
  - Positioned to avoid overlapping with "Un·" text
  - Enhanced opacity for visibility (0.2-0.35 range)
- **Animation**: Soft shadow effects for nighttime ambiance

### **7.3: Technical Implementation ✅ COMPLETED**

**Integration Points:**
- **Main Game Page**: `App.tsx` - Primary game interface
- **Leaderboard Modal**: `GameSummaryModal.tsx` - Results display
- **Scaling Support**: Optional scaling prop for modal use (`scaled={true}`)

**Performance Features:**
- **Efficient Updates**: 60-second interval checks (not real-time)
- **CSS Transitions**: Hardware-accelerated animations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals on unmount
- **Responsive Sizing**: Uses `clamp()` for fluid scaling

**Next**: Phase 8 - Additional game enhancements

## Theme Guessing Feature Implementation Plan

1. Add a nullable `theme_guess` column to the `game_sessions` table to store a player's guess for the weekly theme. This column will be optional and can be left null if the player chooses not to guess.
2. Do NOT add a `theme_guess_day` or `theme_bonus` column. The day can be inferred from the session's timestamp if needed, and theme performance will be tracked independently from daily word scoring.
3. Track theme guesses for leaderboard/statistics by querying the `game_sessions` table for non-null `theme_guess` values. Correctness and fuzzy matching will be handled in application logic.
4. The UI will allow players to optionally guess the theme at any time during the week, or skip guessing entirely.
5. No new tables are required for this feature; all tracking is handled in the existing `game_sessions` table.

---

### ✅ **Fuzzy Matching Deployment Fix (January 2025)** **COMPLETED**

**Issue**: Both frontend and backend failing to deploy due to:
- **Backend**: TypeScript compilation error in `theme-status.ts` - `isThemeGuessCorrect()` was converted to async for fuzzy matching but some callers were using it synchronously
- **Frontend**: Syntax error in `ThemeGuessModal.tsx` from commit `321e507` (WIP commit with broken JSX structure)

**Root Cause**: Deployment was using broken WIP commit `321e507` that had incomplete fuzzy matching implementation with syntax errors.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Backend (`pages/api/theme-status.ts`)**:
   - Updated `isThemeGuessCorrect()` call to be async: `const guessResult = await isThemeGuessCorrect(progress.themeGuess, currentTheme);`
   - Extract `isCorrect` from rich response object: `isCorrectGuess = guessResult.isCorrect;`
   - Function now properly handles async fuzzy matching validation

2. **Frontend (`client/src/components/ThemeGuessModal.tsx`)**:
   - Fixed state persistence issue: Clear `lastGuessResult` when modal opens to prevent data from previous games
   - Enhanced fuzzy matching UI with similarity bar and feedback messages
   - Added proper JSX structure for conditional rendering

3. **Deployment**:
   - Committed fixes as commit `08b46d8`
   - Pushed to main branch to trigger new deployments
   - Both frontend and backend now build successfully

**Result**: ✅ **Deployment pipeline restored** - Both frontend and backend now deploy successfully with complete fuzzy matching implementation.
