# Un¬∑Define Scoring System Guide

## üéØ How Scoring Works (December 2024)

Un¬∑Define uses a **positive reward system** that gives you points for good performance rather than taking them away for mistakes. Here's exactly how your score is calculated and what determines your leaderboard ranking.

## **üìä Scoring Formula**

```
Your Score = Base Points for Guess Number + Fuzzy Match Bonuses - Time Penalty - Hint Penalty
```

### **üéÆ Base Points by Guess Number (85-98% of your score)**

This is the **biggest factor** in your score:

| Guess Number | Base Points | % of Perfect Score |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **1st guess** | **1,000 points** | 100% (Perfect!) |
| **2nd guess** | **900 points** | 90% |
| **3rd guess** | **800 points** | 80% |
| **4th guess** | **700 points** | 70% |
| **5th guess** | **600 points** | 60% |
| **6th guess** | **500 points** | 50% |

**Key Insight:** Getting the word in fewer guesses is BY FAR the most important factor.

### **üß© Fuzzy Match Bonuses (2-8% boost)**

When you guess a word that's "close" to the target (like "DEFINE" when the answer is "DEFIED"), you get **bonus points**:

- **+25 points per fuzzy match**
- These reward you for thinking of related words
- Help you rank higher than players who made random guesses

### **‚è±Ô∏è Time Penalty (0.5-5% of typical games)**

Time matters, but much less than you might think:

- **-1 point per 10 seconds**
- 30 seconds = -3 points
- 60 seconds = -6 points
- 2 minutes = -12 points

**Key Insight:** Unless you take over 3-4 minutes, time barely affects your score.

### **üí° Hint Penalty (Future Feature)**

When hints are added:
- **-200 points if you use any hints**
- Significant penalty to reward players who solve without help

## **üèÜ What Actually Determines Your Ranking**

### **1. Guess Count (Primary Factor - ~90% importance)**
- Players with 1 guess beat players with 2 guesses
- Players with 2 guesses beat players with 3 guesses
- And so on...

### **2. Fuzzy Matches (Tie-Breaker - ~8% importance)**
- Among players with same guess count, fuzzy matches help you rank higher
- Example: Both got it in 3 guesses, but you had 2 fuzzy matches ‚Üí you rank higher

### **3. Time (Final Tie-Breaker - ~2% importance)**
- Only matters when everything else is tied
- Faster time wins in very close matches

## **üí° Real Examples from the Game**

### **Example 1: Your Recent Game**
```
Word: DEFINE
Guesses: 3 (including 2 fuzzy matches)
Time: ~18 seconds
```

**Score Calculation:**
- Base (3rd guess): 800 points (97.8% of score)
- Fuzzy bonus (2 matches): +50 points (+6.1%)
- Time penalty (~18s): -2 points (-0.2%)
- **Final Score: 848 points ‚Üí Rank #5**

**Why #5?** Players with 1-2 guesses ranked higher, but your fuzzy matches helped you beat other 3-guess players.

### **Example 2: Perfect Game**
```
Word: DEFINE
Guesses: 1
Time: 30 seconds
```

**Score Calculation:**
- Base (1st guess): 1,000 points (99.7% of score)
- Time penalty (30s): -3 points (-0.3%)
- **Final Score: 997 points ‚Üí Rank #1**

### **Example 3: Slower but Smart Game**
```
Word: DEFINE  
Guesses: 2 (1 fuzzy match)
Time: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
```

**Score Calculation:**
- Base (2nd guess): 900 points (98.6% of score)
- Fuzzy bonus (1 match): +25 points (+2.7%)
- Time penalty (120s): -12 points (-1.3%)
- **Final Score: 913 points ‚Üí Still beats most 3+ guess players**

## **üéØ Strategy Tips**

### **For Higher Scores:**
1. **Think before guessing** - Each wrong guess costs you 100 base points
2. **Use your vocabulary** - Fuzzy matches give you bonus points
3. **Don't stress about time** - A few extra seconds won't hurt your score much
4. **Make educated guesses** - Random guesses won't trigger fuzzy bonuses

### **For Better Rankings:**
1. **Guess count matters most** - Focus on getting it right quickly
2. **Fuzzy matches break ties** - Think of related words when unsure
3. **Time is least important** - Better to think for 30 extra seconds than waste a guess

## **üß† Why This System Works**

### **Positive Psychology**
- **Rewards achievement**: "You earned 900 points!" vs "You lost 100 points"
- **Encourages learning**: Fuzzy matches reward vocabulary knowledge
- **Reduces frustration**: Close attempts are recognized and rewarded

### **Strategic Depth**
- **Early guessing is optimal** but not the only path to success
- **Vocabulary knowledge helps** through fuzzy match bonuses
- **Multiple paths to victory** depending on your strengths

### **Fair Competition**
- **Skill-based ranking**: Knowledge and strategy matter most
- **Minimal luck factor**: Time pressure is light, focus on thinking
- **Accessible to all**: Clear rules, predictable outcomes

## **üìà Score Ranges and What They Mean**

| Score Range | What It Means | Typical Performance |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **950-1000** | Exceptional | 1-2 guesses, very fast |
| **850-949** | Excellent | 2-3 guesses, good fuzzy help |
| **750-849** | Good | 3-4 guesses, some fuzzy matches |
| **650-749** | Fair | 4-5 guesses, slower time |
| **500-649** | Learning | 5-6 guesses, needs practice |

## **‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: Why did someone with the same guess count rank higher than me?**
A: They likely had more fuzzy matches (bonus points) or a slightly faster time.

### **Q: Is it worth taking extra time to think of a better guess?**
A: Yes! Time penalty is minimal (-1 point per 10 seconds), but wrong guesses cost 100 base points.

### **Q: Do fuzzy matches really help my ranking?**
A: Absolutely! They're often the tie-breaker between players with the same guess count.

### **Q: Should I guess quickly or think more carefully?**
A: Think carefully. An extra 30-60 seconds costs you only 3-6 points, but a wrong guess costs 100 points.

### **Q: How much does time actually matter?**
A: Very little in most games. Only when scores are extremely close (within ~10 points) does time become the deciding factor.
