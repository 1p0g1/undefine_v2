# All-Time Leaderboard Roadmap

## 🎯 **WORDLE-INSPIRED FEATURES**

Based on Wordle's success and best practices for word games, here's our roadmap for advanced leaderboard features.

## 📊 **CURRENT DATA FOUNDATION**

From your `leaderboard_summary` screenshot, we have excellent data:
- ✅ **Player performance**: `was_top_10`, `best_time`, `guesses_used`
- ✅ **Historical tracking**: Date-based records
- ✅ **Unique players**: Multiple player IDs with consistent performance
- ✅ **Daily snapshots**: Immutable end-of-day rankings

## 🏆 **PHASE 1: CORE ALL-TIME STATS** (Next Priority)

### **Player Profile System**
```sql
-- New table for comprehensive player statistics
CREATE TABLE player_all_time_stats (
  player_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  total_games_played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_games_won INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  win_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  max_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  average_time DECIMAL(8,2) DEFAULT 0,
  average_guesses DECIMAL(4,2) DEFAULT 0,
  total_top_10_finishes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  first_place_finishes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  best_time_overall INTEGER DEFAULT NULL,
  fastest_guess_count INTEGER DEFAULT NULL,
  last_played_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Statistics We Can Calculate**
1. **Win Rate**: `total_games_won / total_games_played`
2. **Average Performance**: Time and guess metrics
3. **Consistency**: Standard deviation of performance
4. **Improvement Trend**: Performance over time
5. **Peak Performance**: Best individual game stats

## 🔥 **PHASE 2: STREAK SYSTEM** (Wordle's Key Feature)

### **Streak Tracking**
```sql
-- Daily streak tracking
CREATE TABLE player_streaks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  streak_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'play', 'win', 'top_10'
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  max_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  streak_start_date DATE,
  last_activity_date DATE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Streak Types** (Inspired by Wordle)
1. **Play Streak**: Consecutive days played
2. **Win Streak**: Consecutive days with successful completion
3. **Top 10 Streak**: Consecutive days finishing in top 10
4. **Sub-2-Minute Streak**: Consecutive fast completions
5. **Perfect Streak**: Consecutive single-guess wins

## 🏅 **PHASE 3: LEADERBOARD CATEGORIES** 

### **Multiple Leaderboard Views**
1. **All-Time Champions**
   - Highest win percentage (min 10 games)
   - Fastest average time
   - Lowest average guesses
   - Most top 10 finishes

2. **Current Streaks**
   - Longest active play streak
   - Longest active win streak
   - Longest active top 10 streak

3. **Record Holders**
   - Fastest single game
   - Most first place finishes
   - Most consistent performer
   - Best improvement over time

4. **Monthly/Weekly Champions**
   - Best performer this month
   - Most improved this week
   - Most games played this period

## 🎮 **PHASE 4: WORDLE-STYLE SHARING** 

### **Share Your Stats**
```typescript
// Generate shareable stats similar to Wordle
interface ShareableStats {
  gamesPlayed: number;
  winPercentage: number;
  currentStreak: number;
  maxStreak: number;
  guessDistribution: number[]; // [1-guess wins, 2-guess wins, etc.]
  averageTime: string;
}

// Example share format:
// Un·Define Stats 🎯
// Games: 47
// Win %: 94
// Current Streak: 12
// Max Streak: 23
// 
// Guess Distribution:
// 1: ████████ 8
// 2: ████████████████ 16
// 3: ████████████ 12
// 4: ██████ 6
// 5: ███ 3
// 6: ██ 2
```

### **Visual Stats Dashboard**
- **Bar charts** for guess distribution
- **Line charts** for performance trends
- **Heat maps** for daily activity
- **Achievement badges** for milestones

## 🎖️ **PHASE 5: ACHIEVEMENT SYSTEM**

### **Wordle-Inspired Achievements**
1. **Speed Demon**: Complete in under 30 seconds
2. **Mind Reader**: Win in 1 guess
3. **Consistency King**: 7-day streak with all top 10 finishes
4. **Century Club**: 100 games played
5. **Perfect Week**: 7 consecutive wins
6. **Lightning Round**: 5 games under 1 minute in a day
7. **Vocabulary Master**: Never miss a guess (high accuracy)
8. **Time Lord**: Best daily time 10+ times

## 💾 **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Using Our Snapshot Foundation**
```sql
-- Leverage daily snapshots for historical analysis
WITH player_performance AS (
  SELECT 
    jsonb_array_elements(final_rankings) as player_data,
    date,
    word_id
  FROM daily_leaderboard_snapshots
  WHERE is_finalized = true
),
player_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    (player_data->>'player_id')::TEXT as player_id,
    (player_data->>'rank')::INTEGER as daily_rank,
    (player_data->>'best_time')::INTEGER as time_taken,
    (player_data->>'guesses_used')::INTEGER as guesses,
    (player_data->>'was_top_10')::BOOLEAN as was_top_10,
    date
  FROM player_performance
)
-- Calculate all-time statistics from historical snapshots
SELECT 
  player_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_games,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE daily_rank = 1) as first_places,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE was_top_10) as top_10_finishes,
  AVG(time_taken) as avg_time,
  AVG(guesses) as avg_guesses,
  MIN(time_taken) as best_time
FROM player_stats
GROUP BY player_id;
```
