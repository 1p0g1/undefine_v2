## Current Status: Production Ready âœ…

All core functionality is working correctly:
- Game sessions create and update properly
- Scores are calculated and stored correctly
- Leaderboards populate automatically on game completion
- Real player data appears immediately in leaderboards
- Foreign key constraints are properly maintained

## Recent Fixes Summary (December 2024)

**Problem**: User completed "DEFINE" in 1 guess but didn't appear as #1 on leaderboard
**Root Cause**: Schema mismatch in updateLeaderboardSummary() function
**Solutions Applied**:
1. Fixed column names: `best_time` instead of `completion_time_seconds`
2. Removed references to non-existent `score` column in leaderboard_summary
3. Added foreign key dependency: user_stats must exist before leaderboard_summary insert
4. Added date filtering for daily leaderboards
5. Updated all documentation to match actual ERD schema

**Result**: New game completions now appear immediately in leaderboard with correct rankings.

## Known Issues: None Currently

The December 2024 fixes resolved all major issues. The system is now functioning as designed with proper data flow from game completion to leaderboard display.
