# Scoring System Weighting Recommendations

## üìä **Analysis Results Summary**

### **Current System Performance**
Based on realistic game scenarios, the current weightings create these effects:

- **Time penalty**: Very forgiving (10 minutes = -60 points, only 7.1% of base score)
- **Fuzzy bonus**: Significant value (2 matches = +100 points, 12.5% of base score)  
- **Hint penalty**: Massive impact (-200 points = 2 guess levels)
- **Speed vs accuracy**: Fast play (2 guesses) beats slow+fuzzy (3 guesses+fuzzy) by 50 points

### **Key Insights**
1. **Fuzzy bonus is well-balanced**: 50 points makes spelling help worthwhile without being overpowered
2. **Time penalty promotes thoughtful play**: Players aren't rushed, can take 5+ minutes without major impact
3. **Hint penalty seems excessive**: 200 points vs 60 points for 10 minutes feels unbalanced
4. **Base score progression works**: 100-point drops create clear incentive structure

## üéØ **Recommendations**

### **‚úÖ Keep Current (Working Well)**

#### **1. Fuzzy Bonus: 50 points**
- **Rationale**: Perfect for post-equivalents spelling help
- **Impact**: Rewards accuracy without being overpowered
- **Game flow**: Aligns with fuzzy matching being most useful after Guess 2

#### **2. Base Score Progression: [1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500]**
- **Rationale**: Creates clear incentive for early guessing
- **Impact**: 100-point drops are noticeable but not punishing
- **Balance**: Rewards semantic understanding from clues

#### **3. Time Penalty: 1 point per 10 seconds**
- **Rationale**: Encourages quicker play without stress
- **Impact**: Allows thoughtful consideration (5 min = -30 points)
- **Philosophy**: Favors accuracy over speed (good for word game)

### **üîß Consider Adjusting**

#### **1. Hint Penalty: 200 ‚Üí 150 points**
- **Current problem**: 200 points = 2 guess levels, feels too harsh
- **Recommendation**: Reduce to 150 points (1.5 guess levels)
- **Rationale**: Should discourage hint usage but not devastate scores
- **Balance**: 150 points = 25 minutes of time penalty (more reasonable)

#### **2. Optional: Scaled Fuzzy Bonus**
- **Current**: Flat 50 points per fuzzy match
- **Alternative**: Scale by guess number (more valuable later)
  - Guess 1-2: 40 points per fuzzy
  - Guess 3-4: 50 points per fuzzy  
  - Guess 5-6: 60 points per fuzzy
- **Rationale**: Fuzzy matching most valuable after equivalents clue
- **Impact**: Rewards spelling accuracy when it matters most

### **‚ùå Don't Change**

#### **1. Don't Increase Time Penalty**
- Current system allows thoughtful play
- Word games benefit from reflection time
- 10-minute games only lose 60 points (reasonable)

#### **2. Don't Reduce Base Score Gaps**
- 100-point drops create clear progression incentive
- Smaller gaps would make guess timing less important
- Current system rewards clue utilization

## üéÆ **Recommended Implementation**

### **Option A: Minimal Change (Recommended)**
```typescript
export const SCORING = {
  GUESS_BASE_SCORES: [1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500], // Keep
  FUZZY_BONUS: 50,                                    // Keep
  TIME_PENALTY_PER_10_SECONDS: 1,                     // Keep
  HINT_PENALTY: 150,                                  // Reduce from 200
};
```

### **Option B: Enhanced System**
```typescript
export const SCORING = {
  GUESS_BASE_SCORES: [1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500], // Keep
  FUZZY_BONUS_BY_GUESS: [40, 40, 50, 50, 60, 60],     // Scale by guess
  TIME_PENALTY_PER_10_SECONDS: 1,                     // Keep
  HINT_PENALTY: 150,                                  // Reduce from 200
};
```

## üìà **Expected Impact**

### **With Hint Penalty Reduction (150 points)**
- **Before**: Hint usage = -200 points (devastating)
- **After**: Hint usage = -150 points (significant but fair)
- **Balance**: 150 points = 1.5 guess levels (more proportional)

### **With Scaled Fuzzy Bonus (Optional)**
- **Early game**: Fuzzy less valuable (40 points) when semantic help coming
- **Late game**: Fuzzy more valuable (60 points) when spelling matters most
- **Natural flow**: Aligns with game progression and clue reveal system

## üéØ **Final Recommendation**

**Implement Option A (Minimal Change)**:
- Reduce hint penalty from 200 to 150 points
- Keep all other weightings unchanged
- System is well-balanced overall, just needs hint penalty adjustment

The current fuzzy bonus of 50 points perfectly aligns with the game mechanics where spelling help becomes most valuable after the equivalents clue is revealed. The time penalty is appropriately forgiving for a word game that benefits from thoughtful consideration.

## üìä **Score Distribution After Changes**

With hint penalty at 150 points:
- **Excellent**: 900-1000 points (Guess 1-2, quick, maybe fuzzy)
- **Good**: 800-900 points (Guess 2-3, reasonable time)
- **Average**: 700-800 points (Guess 3-4, some time/fuzzy)
- **Poor**: 500-700 points (Guess 5-6, slow, minimal help)
- **With hint**: -150 points from any category (fair penalty)

This maintains the same healthy score distribution while making hint usage less devastating.
